# Interactive-Story-One

1) Overview

I want to create an interactive fiction with light RPG (role-playing game) elements
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

2) Considerations

   2a) How can I effectively combine text-based storytelling with RPG mechanics in
       a meaningful and entertaining way?

   2b) How could imagery be used to enhance the user experience?

3) Major Areas

  3a) Main Story 

    The main section of the program will, of course, be the interactive narrative. 

  3b) Interactivity 

  3c) User Interface 

4) Inspiration

This project was inspired by both an internal and an external factor. 

The internal factor is my need to experiment and push my creativity to new levels. 
I've been writing fiction for several years now, and although I still love writing 
traditional fiction, I have a desire to bring my characters, worlds, and stories to 
life in other ways. 

The external factor is a niche of fiction called LitRPGs -- or, literary role-playing 
games. Essentially, LitRPGs attempt to capture the experience of playing a role-playing 
video game. As a fan of role-playing games, I find the idea fascinating. In reality, 
however, I think the genre falls short. So, by using programming to add interactivity 
to the stories, I hope to push the genre to new limits. I still want to retain the 
feeling of reading a book, but with some interactivity to allow the RPG elements to 
affect the narrative.
